## Project Roadmap

The plan for delivering Windows Terminal
2.0 [is described here](https://github.com/035059/EmployeeCardNFC/doc/project-roadmap.md) and will be updated as the
project proceeds.

## Project Build Status

## Overview of use

Please take a few minutes to review the overview below before diving into the code:

### Main - Time manager

Windows Terminal is a new, modern, feature-rich, productive terminal application for command-line users. It includes
many of the features most frequently requested by the Windows command-line community including support for tabs, rich
text, globalization, configurability, theming & styling, and more.

The Terminal will also need to meet our goals and measures to ensure it remains fast and efficient, and doesn't consume
vast amounts of memory or power.
